## Introduction

[**Narrative Chart**](https://narchart.github.io) is an open-source visualization library specialized for authoring charts that facilitate data storytelling with a high-level action-oriented declarative grammar. The library is implemented in JavaScript and compatible with most modern web browsers.

Unlike existing visualization libraries such as *D3.js*, *Vega*, and *Apache ECharts*, Narrative Chart is designed to meet the needs of data storytelling specifically and lower the barrier of creating such charts. The grammar of Narrative Chart is simple and intuitive to learn, even for non-expert users, as it mimics the real actions of designers. Besides, Narrative Chart has rich supportive features for visual narratives, which enables users to rapidly create expressive charts and inspires their creativity.
